- In midst of integrating game progression to be saved to local storage, which requires a much different design around a tracking array (in this case, 'saveData').
- Need game save & load functionality once game is more advanced. For testing purposes, manipulating array manually right now will suffice.
- Locations finally works, with integration with kill counts coming soon (currently, you must kill 3 at one level to move on to next level).
- Testing buttons are available while in development for testing purposes.
