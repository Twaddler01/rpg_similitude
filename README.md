- New updates to locations. Working on 'previous' and 'next' buttons. Can "one shot" which will be a kill (in one click) and later be the main trigger from enemy deaths.

- In midst of integrating game progression to be saved to local storage, which requires a much different design around a tracking array (in this case, 'saveData').
- Temporarily moved some functions and variables being worked on to main.js for simplicity.
- Need game save & load functionality once game is more advanced. For testing purposes, manipulating array manually right now will suffice. This feature is easy to integrate when ready.
- Locations finally work, with integration with kill counts coming soon (currently, will set up where user must kill 3 at one level to move on to next level). These values can be easily adjusted later as necessary.
- Testing buttons will be available while in development for testing purposes.
