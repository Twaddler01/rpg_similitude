VSIM KNOWN ISSUES

* An unnecessary empty space is above the UPGRADE section -- disappears only when the CONVERT section is made visible.
* Clicking purchase buttons quickly can result in extra purchases even if resources are insufficient, causing even a negative number of resources being available.
* Sections are too easy to accidentally collapse/expand.
* Game progress does not save.
